# NET9 Clean Architecture CQRS API

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a .NET 9 API implementation following the Clean Architecture principles. It incorporates CQRS, MediatR, Fluent Validation, and other best practices to create a modular, scalable, and maintainable API.


## 🚀 Technologies Used

.NET 9 - Latest .NET framework version

CQRS - Command and Query Responsibility Segregation pattern

MediatR - Decoupled request handling

Fluent Validation - Elegant and powerful validation

Entity Framework Core - ORM for database interactions

Clean Architecture - Layered architecture for maintainability

## 🔧 Features

✅ Command & Query pattern implementation

✅ Centralized validation with Fluent Validation

✅ MediatR-based request handling

✅ Layered architecture for maintainability

✅ Custom exception handling middleware

✅ Advanced Repository Implementation (Synchronous & Asynchronous)

✅ Dynamic Search Implementation

✅ Automapper-based Request-Response Mapping

✅ Best Practice-Oriented Entity Framework Implementation

✅ Advanced Caching (InMemory & Redis Cache)

✅ Logging with Serilog
